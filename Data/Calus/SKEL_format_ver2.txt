SKEL file format (skeletal animation) v.2
--------------------------------------

ACSII file, containing successive skeletal frames ( only one skeleton per frame is supported for now ).
Each frame consists of 74 lines of text and has the following structure:

Line count            Description
-----			---------------------------------
1               Header
24				skeleton joint positions (one joint per line)
1				skeleton joint rotation confidence ( this line contains 24 numbers which represent the confidence in each joint rotation data)
24				skeleton joint hierarchical orientation quaternions and rotation matrices(one joint per line)
24				skeleton joint absolute orientation quaternions and rotation matrices (one joint per line)

The header has the form W X Y Z
where 
W = frame number. Each skel file begins with 0 frame number and incremens by 1.
X = frame id
Y = frame timestamp (kinect timestamp)
Z = global timestamp (system timestamp)

Each joint position entry has the form
X Y Z C
where
X,Y,Z are the coordinates of the joint location and
C is the joint confidence

The joint rotations are described by 20 floating point numbers per line ( one line per joint )
The first 4 numbers is the rotation quaternion in the form ( W X Y Z), and the remaining 16 is the rotation matrix in row major order ( 4x4 matrix , row-by-row )


The skeleton consists of 24 joints of which 4 are inactive (zero entries), leaving 20 tracked joints. ( see Microsoft Kinect SDK documentation for more details, link provided below)
The order of joints is as follows (careful!!!,  this enumeration is more in line with OpenNI libraries, so the order of joints is not the same as in MS SDK)
		KW_SKEL_HEAD			= 1,
		KW_SKEL_NECK			= 2,
		KW_SKEL_TORSO			= 3,
		KW_SKEL_WAIST			= 4,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_COLLAR		= 5, (inactive)
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_SHOULDER	= 6,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_ELBOW		= 7,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_WRIST		= 8,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_HAND		= 9,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_FINGERTIP	=10, (inactive)
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_COLLAR	=11, (inactive)
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_SHOULDER	=12,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_ELBOW		=13,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_WRIST		=14,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_HAND		=15,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_FINGERTIP	=16, (inactive)
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_HIP		=17,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_KNEE		=18,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_ANKLE		=19,
		KW_SKEL_LEFT_FOOT		=20,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_HIP		=21,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_KNEE		=22,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_ANKLE		=23,
		KW_SKEL_RIGHT_FOOT		=24

The recorded sequences will consist of a number of skel files, one per device. ( skel, skel_2, skel_3, skel_4)
In addition a skel file with the fuzed skeleton animation will be provided. 
The recorded framerate is expected to be 30fps. In case of 15fps recordings, special annotations will be made.
